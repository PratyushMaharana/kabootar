# Impact of Urbanization on Bird Vocalizations
Urbanization has significantly altered natural soundscapes, raising concerns about its effects on bird communication. This study investigates how increased anthropogenic noise influences the vocal characteristics of birds in urban environments compared to rural areas.

By analyzing bird song recordings from different habitats, we aim to identify variations in pitch, frequency, amplitude, and duration of vocalizations. Using audio processing techniques such as spectrogram analysis, we quantify these changes. Preliminary evidence suggests that birds in urban environments may adapt by shifting to higher frequencies or increasing vocal amplitude to overcome background noise pollution.

This research provides insights into how birds modify their communication strategies in response to human-induced environmental changes, with implications for conservation and urban planning.
